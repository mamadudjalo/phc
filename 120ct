Von Neumann added in a number of idas that made digital computing pratical and is ideas remain those of most digital programming to this day
Contemporary computer designs are based on concepts developed by Jonh con Neumann at the Institude for Advanced Studies 

Von Neumann architecture is based on three key concepts:
  Data and instructions are stored in a singles read-write memory
  The contents of this memory asre adressable by location, without regard to the type of data contained there
  Execution occurs in a sequential fashion(unless explicitly modified) from one instrcution to the next
  
Cpu
  The cpu is often known as the brain of the computer
  Its jobs is to process data which mean things like seraching , sorting , calculating  and decision making 

Arithmetic and Logic Unit(ALU)
  Performs basic arithmetic operations such as adding
  Performs logical operatiosn such as True, False, Equal to,Greather than,AND,OR , and NOT
